**The Feudal System**

The feudal system in medieval Europe was a hierarchical social structure in which the land was owned by the lord and worked by serfs who were technically free but effectively bound to the land they worked. The Catholic Church also owned vast tracts of land and became very wealthy by collecting tithes and rents on its lands. Life for serfs was difficult, with high rates of mortality and poor living conditions.

**Agrarian Society**

In an agrarian society, the seasons dictated the rhythm of life. Peasants worked hard, tilling the soil, planting crops, harvesting hay, and tending to livestock. The coming of fall meant preparing for winter, including butchering livestock and preserving food. The Church played a central role in medieval society, overseeing special ceremonies and providing explanations for supernatural events and forces of nature.

**The Christian Church**

After the fall of Rome, the Christian Church became the only organized institution in medieval Europe. In 1054, the Great Schism led to a split between the eastern and western branches of Christianity, each maintaining a strict organizational hierarchy. The Roman Catholic Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe, with the pope overseeing a large bureaucracy.

**Spread of Christianity**

As Christianity spread throughout Europe, it replaced pagan and animistic views, offering explanations for supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms. The Church also played a central role in village and family life, overseeing special ceremonies that marked every stage of life.

**Conclusion**

Overall, the feudal system and the Catholic Church were central to the organization and functioning of medieval European society, shaping the lives and beliefs of the people during this time period.
