“Distance and inadequate training in agricultural pursuits closed the frontier to eastern workingmen; instead  America was settled by successive waves of farmers who were already skilled in wresting a living from the  soil. Farming, even before the day of mechanization, was a highly technical profession; frontiering required a  knowledge of even more specialized techniques. Clearing the land, building a home, fencing fields, solving  the problem of defense, and planting crops on virgin soil all demanded experience few workingmen could  boast. . . .  “. . . Romantic characters took part [in frontier migration]: . . . trappers and leatherclad ‘Mountain Men,’  starry-eyed prospectors and hard-riding cowboys, badmen and vigilantes. But the true hero of the tale was the  hard-working farmer who, ax in hand, marched ever westward until the boundaries of his nation touched the  Pacific.”  Ray Allen Billington,   historian,   Westward   Expansion:   A   History   of   the  American   Frontier,   1949  “The rapid expansion of wagework in the United States . . . and the most intensive phase of the exploitation  and settlement of the western third of the continent were roughly contemporaneous processes that occurred  during   a   seventy-year   interval   [beginning   in   1848]. Y  et,   at   first   glance,   the   terms   frontier   and   wagework   seem  to describe mutually exclusive conditions. . . . In actuality, . . . one such conjunction [of these terms] was the  wageworkers’ frontier. . . .  “. . . The wageworkers’ frontier . . . was foremost a predominantly male community of manual labor  dependent upon others for wages in the extractive industries of the sparsely settled Rocky Mountain and  Pacific regions of the United States. . . . It also represented a zone of extremely rapid transition from  wilderness to industrial, post-frontier society. . . . The wageworkers’ frontier was a fragile entity forever at the  mercy of the outside world’s pricing of its basic [export] commodities. . . . All [commodities] were shippedout of the west because the Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions contained too few people . . . to constitute a  viable home market. Settlements on the wageworkers’ frontier tended to resemble factory towns in  Pennsylvania or Massachusetts.”  Carlos A. Schwantes, historian, “The Concept of the W  ageworkers’ Frontier,”  1987
